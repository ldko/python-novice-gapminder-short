## Most of the power of a programming language is in its libraries.

*   A *library* is a collection of files (called *modules*) that contains
    functions for use by other programs.
    *   May also contain data values (e.g., numerical constants) and other things.
    *   Library's contents are supposed to be related, but there's no way to enforce that.
*   The Python [standard library][stdlib] is an extensive suite of modules that comes
    with Python itself.
*   Many additional libraries are available from [PyPI][pypi] (the Python Package Index).
*   We will see later how to write new libraries.

## A program must import a library module before using it.

*   Use `import` to load a library module into a program's memory.
*   Then refer to things from the module as `module_name.thing_name`.
    *   Python uses `.` to mean "part of".
*   Using `math`, one of the modules in the standard library:

~~~
import math

print('pi is', math.pi)
print('cos(pi) is', math.cos(math.pi))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
pi is 3.141592653589793
cos(pi) is -1.0
~~~
{: .output}

*   Have to refer to each item with the module's name.
    *   `math.cos(pi)` won't work.

## Use `help` to learn about the contents of a library module.

*   Works just like help for a function.
*   Must first import the library.

help(math)

DESCRIPTION
    This module is always available.  It provides access to the
    mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

FUNCTIONS
    acos(x, /)
        Return the arc cosine (measured in radians) of x.
